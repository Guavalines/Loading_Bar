# LOADING BAR

Check it out here: [Loading Bar](https://guavalines.github.io/Loading_Bar/)

This code creates a loading bar animation that fills up to 100% by incrementing a variable and updating the width and text properties of two HTML elements. Its highlights include using querySelector to select elements from the DOM, defining two const variables to reference the relevant elements, and implementing the updateNum function to recursively update the loading bar every 20 milliseconds until it reaches 100%. The accompanying HTML document displays the loading bar, percentage counter, and a "Loading" heading.
